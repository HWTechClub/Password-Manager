Important Note: You must be in the front-end directory before running startPage.py. This is to prevent file not found errors. 

Created a new python file called securityUtils in the fron-end firctory that contains all the security functions. This file is basically an updated 
version of security.py which is in the security directory.

Added code for sign up. This code creates an empty file 'user.json' in the passwords directory. This file will contain the account info for the
user's various accounts. If user signed up previously, then user should be taken to the main screen.

Added code that does the decryption of user.json file when user logs in. Must encrypt this file when user logs out / exits from app.

Moved initialization of salt to the create_key() function in security.py and securityUtils.py
